# Elm Bezier

This package is for working with cubic Bezier curves and is specifically made as a dependency for [Elm Animator](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-animator/1.1.1/).

A good amount of this code was borrowed from [Elm Geometry](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-geometry), though the `Bezier.Spring` module is largely unique (though it was written with a considerable amount of help from Ian Mackenzie, for which I am very grateful!)
